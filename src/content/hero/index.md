I'm a full stack developer with experience ranging from frontend over backend to mobile development and I have written successful apps with technologies in all of these sections.

When I'm not working on my own projects, I may be available for consulting. I help companies manage and writer better code, make their software more robust, and coach other people how to be more efficient.
