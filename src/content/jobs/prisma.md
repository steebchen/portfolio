- Prisma is a database toolkit to make the life of developers easier. It provides a fully type-safe abstraction over your database.
- Primarily, I built Prisma's Go client which builds on top of their Rust database engine. Since Prisma focused on NodeJS for business reasons, I was responsible for all aspects which come with a new database client. It included product research and a lot feedback sessions with customers and companies, researching how the syntax could look like, planning and product management, and of course actually developing the Go client from the ground up.
- Apart from working on the Go client, I helped Prisma in various aspects, such as end to end tests for our NodeJS client for an array cloud providers, bug fixes in our query engine written in Rust as well as our CLI, and a lot of involvement in product processes, CI/CD in and testing in many different places.
