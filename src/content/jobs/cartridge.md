- Cartridge is a blockchain company that develops and operates the open-source Dojo Engine, a blockchain-based gaming engine.
- Dojo games are open-source, composable, extensible, permissionless, persistent, and tap into the power and economics of the blockchain.
- I joined Cartridge to take over development operations, focusing on tooling that enables developers to interact with the Dojo Engine.
- Additionally, I am learning Rust and Cairo to contribute to the Dojo Engine's development.
