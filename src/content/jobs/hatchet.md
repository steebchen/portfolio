- Hatchet is a distributed, fault-tolerant task queue that replaces traditional message brokers and pub/sub systems, addressing issues like concurrency, fairness, and durability.
- I joined Hatchet early on to accelerate the development of the first product version, focusing on webhook workers to enable use with serverless environments like Lambda, Vercel, and Cloudflare Workers.
- I also set up e2e and performance tests, ensured clean code, and contributed to other CI/CD pipelines and improvements.
