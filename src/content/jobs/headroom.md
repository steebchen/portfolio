- Headroom is an AI-driven video conferencing tool which indexes all meetings and makes them searchable after they ended
- I built the infrastructure on Google Cloud from the ground up, including setting up the Kubernetes cluster, networking via WebRTC, while managing all infrastructure with Terraform
- The software also not just records everything and generates searchable text snippets, but also offers collaboration tools for notes and comments
- Real-time facial recognition for participant happiness indicators to analyze to "read the room" virtually
