# Portfolio

My personal portfolio site at [luca-steeb.com](https://luca-steeb.com),
originally designed & developed by [Brittany Chiang](bchiang7/v4).

This site uses [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), a modern and fast static site generator.

To run the app locally, clone it and run the following:

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
